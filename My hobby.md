# My hobby

Hello, my name is Tatyana. 
I'm 20 years old.
I want to tell you about my hobby.

**I have 2 hobbies:**
* [read books](#books)
* [watch TV series/movies/YouTube](#seriesmoviesyoutube)

## Books

I have some favorite books. One of my favorite books written by Anna Jane **"The Fan"**. In this book, a mysterious man gives a girl an even number of flowers and pursues her. The girl is scared because she thinks he wants to kill her. Almost to the very end, the book retains the intrigue.

## Series/movies/YouTube
1. One of my favorite movies is **"Harry Potter"**. In fact , I like all the episodes of this story. This is an amazing magical story. There are philosophical thoughts in these films.

[I liked the phrase from the movie:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nRvGt2vwts) 

> The world is not divided into good and bad, everyone has both a light and a dark side, the main thing is which side you chose - it determines everything
>
> *Sirius Black*

2. I also like the TV series "Closed School". There are many mysteries and unexpected moments in it. I hope that someday there will be a sequel to this series.

2. Most often I watch YouTube, because there you can find a lot of different interesting videos.
